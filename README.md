## The Evolution of Excellence

What began as a humble desire to integrate Deep Learning into Collaborative Filtering evolved into an extraordinary tale of innovation:

1. **Cold Start Conundrum Solved:** We cast aside the shadows of the cold start problem by harnessing the power of Information Theory. New users are welcomed into a world of tailored recommendations.

2. **Information Theory Magic:** Information Theory becomes the spellbook, as we conjure unique user embeddings for new explorers. This masterstroke ignites a symphony of personalized recommendations.

3. **Hyperparameters Perfected:** Optuna, the hyperparameter oracle, guides the model's transformation. The art of hyperparameter tuning brings forth a model optimized for cinematic brilliance.

4. **Empowering New Users:** A twist in the plot â€“ new users are invited to rate a curated film selection. This ritual empowers the model to unveil recommendations that captivate the heart and soul.

5. **Evaluating Cinematic Excellence:** Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) takes the stage alongside the dynamic duo of Precision and Recall at K. Together, they redefine the metric of recommendation quality.

## Embarking on the Cinematic Odyssey

Join us on this cinematic odyssey by taking these steps:
1. There are no steps just run the notebook!!

## A Glimpse of the Future

The finale is yet to come! My ultimate vision is a Group Movie Recommender System â€“ a single click to harmonize cinematic choices for our 6-person hostel room. Imagine the symphony of preferences as the model curates perfect movie nights.
